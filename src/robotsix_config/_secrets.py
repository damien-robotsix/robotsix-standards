"""Writing a config file with the standard ``0600``/``0700`` permissions.

The robotsix config standard requires that any config file containing real
secrets is created ``0600`` inside a ``0700`` directory. Enforcing it in shared
loader code (rather than per-repo, or only in docstrings) is what makes the
guarantee real across the stack.
